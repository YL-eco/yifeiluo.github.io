  <p>
  I study the persistent effects of the 1932–34 famine in Ukraine. Exploiting exogenous weather shocks and selecting the strongest predictor of famine intensity, I show that: (i) regions with greater famine exposure are less integrated into international trade and exhibit higher within-region inequality, with effects on trade more pronounced for exports than imports; (ii) famine exposure significantly reduces import activity with Russia, though the decline is compensated by increased imports from China, the United States, and the European Union; (iii) famine exposure is associated with a more salient Ukrainian identity, often incompatible with alternative identities such as Russian, Eastern Slavic, or religious affiliations—helping explain the rupture in import ties; (iv) individuals in more severely affected regions remain trapped in poorer economic conditions and are less likely to be politically active, contributing to export underperformance due to reduced economic competitiveness; (v) empirical evidence on intergenerational transmission confirms theoretical predictions, underscoring the role of the political environment in shaping cultural value persistence; and (vi) education programs are likely among the key mechanisms through which these long-term effects are sustained. The results are robust to classical IV diagnostics, placebo tests, migration correction, and falsification tests using randomly generated outcome variables with identical spatial distribution.

  <p>
  I develop a dynamic model to study the interaction between intergenerational cultural value transmission and the elite's choice of regime ideology. The model allows regimes to be stationary, time-varying, and ultimately endogenously chosen by elites. I first show that, under any regime choice, the initial distribution of cultural values will almost surely lead to the extinction of one value. I then analyze a two-period regime sequence, demonstrating that the duration of the initial regime is critical in preventing ideological backlash when institutions change. I characterize the minimum duration required for early-period policymakers to ensure that their preferred cultural value dominates in the long run, regardless of future regime shifts. Finally, I endogenize regime choice by modeling elite preferences, showing how the initial cultural allocation determines whether long-term policy stabilizes or cycles, causing fluctuations in the dominant cultural value.
