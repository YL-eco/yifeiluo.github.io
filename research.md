        I study the persistent effects of the 1932–34 famine in Ukraine. Exploiting exogenous weather shocks and selecting the strongest predictor of famine intensity, I show that: (i) regions with greater famine exposure are less integrated into international trade and exhibit higher within-region inequality, with effects on trade more pronounced for exports than imports; (ii) famine exposure significantly reduces import activity with Russia, though the decline is compensated by increased imports from China, the United States, and the European Union; (iii) famine exposure is associated with a more salient Ukrainian identity, often incompatible with alternative identities such as Russian, Eastern Slavic, or religious affiliations—helping explain the rupture in import ties; (iv) individuals in more severely affected regions remain trapped in poorer economic conditions and are less likely to be politically active, contributing to export underperformance due to reduced economic competitiveness; (v) empirical evidence on intergenerational transmission confirms theoretical predictions, underscoring the role of the political environment in shaping cultural value persistence; and (vi) education programs are likely among the key mechanisms through which these long-term effects are sustained. The results are robust to classical IV diagnostics, placebo tests, migration correction, and falsification tests using randomly generated outcome variables with identical spatial distribution.

        I develop a dynamic model to study the interaction between intergenerational cultural value transmission and the elite’s choice of regime ideology. The model allows regimes to be stationary, time-varying, and ultimately endogenously chosen by elites. I first show that, under any regime choice, the initial distribution of cultural values will almost surely lead to the extinction of one value. I then analyze a two-period regime sequence, demonstrating that the duration of the initial regime is critical in preventing ideological backlash when institutions change. I characterize the minimum duration required for early-period policymakers to ensure that their preferred cultural value dominates in the long run, regardless of future regime shifts. Finally, I endogenize regime choice by modeling elite preferences, showing how the initial cultural allocation determines whether long-term policy stabilizes or cycles, causing fluctuations in the dominant cultural value.

        We investigate the shock suffered by the primary sector in Syria, following the outbreak of the civil war in March 2011. We incorporate remote sensing data with machine learning (ML) to address data unavailability in weak-state settings and evaluate agricultural disruption while conflict is ongoing. We split the analysis locally and at a larger-area scale. Using staggered Difference-in-Differences (SDID) at patch level, we find temporary negative war effects on agricultural activity for zones directly affected by combat, concentrated in the short run (about 5 years). We also note anticipatory effects consistent with preventive migration. We then adopt a patch-donuts strategy to quantify spillovers in indirectly affected territories. Spillovers are persistently negative, suggesting policy should support both directly affected localities and adjacent areas. Due to data limitations, we cannot identify the maximal spillover effect. Finally, at sub-district level we run Two-Way Fixed Effects and IV (distance to closest city as an instrument) to gauge impacts incorporating local equilibrium effects; results suggest conflict-related damage to agriculture, especially when state forces are involved in threatened operations.

## Research in Progress

### Cognitive richness, learning models, and evolutionarily stable Berk–Nash equilibrium
**Summary:** Real world decision making often times entail bounded rationality due to feasibility restriction of mental model. I adapt classical Berk–Nash equilibrium in decision making and augment it with cognitive richness (volume of mental model) and learning of alternative models. The setting allows me to characterize evolutionarily stable distribution of the product measure of reference frame and cognitive richness under different objective environment. Being mentally rich bear incremental cost over the task volume thereby negatively affect the fitness. Finally, I apply the equilibrium definition over various types of applications.

### Behavioral selection of immigrants
**Summary:** I developed theory explaining the set of behavioral characteristics that determines one’s migration decision from the sending country to the destination country in additional to wage and migration costs. I adapted a method that employs survey data to mark a ranking of individuals within the country and that specific dimension. I use WVS, ESS, Afrobarometer, and EVS to empirically verify the migration decision and quantify how much does the behavioral costs/benefits distorts one’s decision relative to pure monetary returns.
