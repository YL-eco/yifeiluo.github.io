        I study the persistent effects of the 1932â€“34 famine in Ukraine. Exploiting exogenous weather shocks and selecting 
        the strongest predictor of famine intensity, I show that: (i) regions with greater famine exposure are less integrated 
        into international trade and exhibit higher within-region inequality, with effects on trade more pronounced for exports 
        than imports; (ii) famine exposure significantly reduces import activity with Russia, though the decline is compensated 
        by increased imports from China, the United States, and the European Union; (iii) famine exposure is associated with 
        a more salient Ukrainian identity, often incompatible with alternative identities such as Russian, Eastern Slavic, or 
        religious affiliationsâ€”helping explain the rupture in import ties; (iv) individuals in more severely affected regions 
        remain trapped in poorer economic conditions and are less likely to be politically active, contributing to export 
        underperformance due to reduced economic competitiveness; (v) empirical evidence on intergenerational transmission 
        confirms theoretical predictions, underscoring the role of the political environment in shaping cultural value persistence; 
        and (vi) education programs are likely among the key mechanisms through which these long-term effects are sustained. 
        The results are robust to classical IV diagnostics, placebo tests, migration correction, and falsification tests using 
        randomly generated outcome variables with identical spatial distribution.

  <h4>Elite Ideology and the Dynamics of Cultural Dominance</h4>

        I develop a dynamic model to study the interaction between intergenerational cultural value transmission and the elite's 
        choice of regime ideology. The model allows regimes to be stationary, time-varying, and ultimately endogenously chosen 
        by elites. I first show that, under any regime choice, the initial distribution of cultural values will almost surely 
        lead to the extinction of one value. I then analyze a two-period regime sequence, demonstrating that the duration of 
        the initial regime is critical in preventing ideological backlash when institutions change. I characterize the minimum 
        duration required for early-period policymakers to ensure that their preferred cultural value dominates in the long run, 
        regardless of future regime shifts. Finally, I endogenize regime choice by modeling elite preferences, showing how the 
        initial cultural allocation determines whether long-term policy stabilizes or cycles, causing fluctuations in the dominant 
        cultural value.
