# About Me

<div class="card">
  <h3>🎯 Research Interests</h3>
  <p>
    My research sits at the intersection of political economy and economic history, with a focus on how historical shocks 
    shape modern culture, social norms, and institutions. I use a mix of empirical methods (causal inference, spatial/data linkage) 
    and formal theory to understand the long-term consequences of historical events.
  </p>
  <p>
    My current work explores the persistent effects of the 1932–34 Ukrainian Famine on trade patterns, inequality, and identity formation, 
    as well as theoretical models of cultural transmission and elite ideology dynamics.

  <h3>🔬 Research Methodology</h3>
  <p>
    My empirical work combines modern econometric techniques with historical data analysis:
  </p>
  <ul class="clean">
    <li><strong>Causal Inference</strong> — Instrumental variables, difference-in-differences, and regression discontinuity designs</li>
    <li><strong>Spatial Analysis</strong> — Geographic information systems and spatial econometrics</li>
    <li><strong>Data Linkage</strong> — Connecting historical records with contemporary datasets</li>
    <li><strong>Formal Theory</strong> — Dynamic models of cultural transmission and institutional change</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>🌍 Beyond Economics</h3>
  <p>
    Beyond my academic work, I'm deeply interested in philosophy, literature, film, and history. 
    These interdisciplinary interests inform my research approach and help me develop more nuanced 
    theoretical frameworks for understanding cultural and institutional persistence.
  </p>
  <p>
    I enjoy experimenting in the kitchen—sometimes to the horror of culinary purists—like pairing 
    curry chicken with croissants. I also dabble in video games and bring my identity thoughts everywhere I go.
