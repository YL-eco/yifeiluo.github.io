# About Me

<div class="card">
  <h3>🎯 Research Interests</h3>
  <p>
    My research sits at the intersection of political economy, and economic history, with a focus on how historical shocks 
    shape modern culture, social norms, technology adoption and development. I use a mix of empirical methods and formal theory to understand the world.
  </p>
  <p>
    My current work explores: immigrants self-selection, identity construction and consequences, narrative, techno-optimism, AI, narrative, scientific claim and causal claim.
    </p>
  <p>
    I have studied in China, USA and France.

  <h3>🌍 Beyond Economics</h3>
  <p>
    Beyond my academic work, I'm deeply interested in philosophy, literature, film, and history. 
    These interdisciplinary interests inform my research approach and help me develop more nuanced 
    theoretical frameworks for understanding cultural and institutional persistence.
  </p>
  <p>
    I enjoy experimenting in the kitchen—sometimes to the horror of culinary purists—like pairing 
    curry chicken with croissants. I also dabble in video games and bring my identity thoughts everywhere I go.
