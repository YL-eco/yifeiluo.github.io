# Bio

My research sits at the intersection of political economy and economic history, with a focus on how historical shocks shape modern culture, social norms, and institutions. I use a mix of empirical methods (causal inference, spatial/data linkage) and formal theory.

Beyond economics, I’m into philosophy, literature, film, and history, and I dabble in video games. I bring my identity thoughs everywhere. In the kitchen I experiment freely—sometimes to the horror of purists—like pairing curry chicken with croissants.
