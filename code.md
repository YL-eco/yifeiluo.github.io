- **Repo:** _coming soon_
- **Replication:** _coming soon_
- **Language:** Python

<details>
  <summary><em>Show usage notes</em></summary>
  <p>
  Batch Lasso for instruments and controls with stability selection; exports selection frequencies and a final IV model. Includes helpers for clustered SEs and FE. Suitable for moderately large dataset.

### **Spatial RI with placebo outcome variable**
_Modifies inference in IV settings to account for spatial persistence using placebo outcomes._
- **Repo:** _coming soon_
- **Replication:** _coming soon_
- **Language:** Python

<details>
  <summary><em>Show usage notes</em></summary>
